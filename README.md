- Think of ways to implement 

- What are the steps

Read in from corpora and take note of the source

Suppose we have 2 corpora
Have 2 different matrices B (but they have the same dimension)

They should share the same word_embeddings
However, when we have viBvj they should give different value depending on 
what copurs matrix B 

HOW TO:
- modify nce_multi_corpus to take in B too
- uhmm
- Or break down the steps of nce_computation
- Use the necessary functions only :|
